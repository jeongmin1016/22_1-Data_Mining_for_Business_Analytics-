The dealer\\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical\\'\\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \\n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\\n\\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal\\' temperatures just have\\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\\ncold temperatures have a `W\\' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\\nplace, you\\'d stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\\n\\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal\\' operating\\ntemperature and a `cold\\' one (though I can\\'t remember the numbers...).\\n\\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\\nsomething.\\n\\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\\noil.  Thin oil won\\'t (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \\nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \\n\\nIf you\\'re planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.

In the early 80\\'s with the\\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\\n\\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\\nin the short run) vehicle?

It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \\nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\\nyou never need a tune-up.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I\\'d say you got a great deal.\\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\\n\\nGood luck.\\n',\n",

The problem is that the car has \\naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\\n\\nThe inspection garage said that they won\\'t pass it unless I get a\\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it\\'s illegal.  He\\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can\\'t have tint, if\\nyou can\\'t see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\\nand said \"It\\'s just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won\\'t argue with that...\\n\\nSince the vehicle code says it\\'s OK as long as you can see through the\\ntint, I\\'d like to keep it (I\\'ll re-read the vehicle code in the\\nlibrary).  I\\'d also like to get some sort of paper from the police\\nthat says it\\'s OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won\\'t\\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn\\'t mind registering\\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\\n\\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \\nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\\n\\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\\n\\nMichal\\n\\n',\n",

Most of the other\\nmodels are in the same class, but aren\\'t the first cars you would think of.\\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn\\'t include domestic small\\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\\nroots.\\n\\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\\n\\nToyota Paseo\\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\\nMazda MX-3\\nIsuzu Impulse\\nGeo Storm\\nFord Escort GT\\n\\n\\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they\\'re more expensive than they\\'re\\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\\n\\nTercel -> Paseo\\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\\nCivic -> del Sol\\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\\n\\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn\\'t offer the power that some 4-doors\\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let\\'s take another example: the\\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\\nmoney for this type of car.  \\n\\n\\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it\\'s market\\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\\n\\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\\n\\n\\nMihir Shah\\n\\t \\n',\n",

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of\\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\\n\\nMy question:\\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to\\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of\\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything\\'s gotta be better than\\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\\n\\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\\nelectronic.  Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying\\nto give information as completly as I can).\\n\\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \\ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\\n\\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \\nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\\n\\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \\n\\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\\n\\t    the questions above)?\\n\\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\\ncars.  So the installation doesn\\'t scare me.  I just want to be certain that\\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\\n\\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don\\'t get over this group very often\\n(but I check my mail all the time).\\n\\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.\\n\\nMike Wieda\\nMikew@canc.byu.edu\\n\\n',\n",

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \\nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \\nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \\nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \\nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \\nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \\ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \\nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \\nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \\ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \\ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \\nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \\nthe turn of events.\\n\\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \\nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \\nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \\nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \\nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \\nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \\npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \\nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \\nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\\n\\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \\napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \\nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \\nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \\nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\\n\\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \\ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \\nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \\ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \\nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \\nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\\n\\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \\nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \\nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \\nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \\nmistake.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \\ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \\nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\\n\\nMark\\n\",\n",

The keywords `Monthly Posting\\'\\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don\\'t\\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\\ndocumentation provided there.\\n\\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\\n\\nrec.autos.tech\\n\\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\\n\\nrec.autos.sport\\n\\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\\n\\nrec.autos.driving\\n\\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\\n\\nrec.autos.vw\\n\\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\\na mailing list.\\n\\nrec.audio.car\\n\\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\\nso is mentioned here.\\n\\nrec.autos.antique\\n\\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\\n\\nalt.hotrod\\n\\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\\nperformance vehicles.\\n\\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\\n\\nalso not part of the `official\\' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\\n\\nalt.autos.karting\\n\\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\\n\\nrec.autos\\n\\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\\n\\n\\nCrossposting:\\n\\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\\n\\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\\n\\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\\n\\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\\n\\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn\\'t care less about\\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\\nrec.autos.\\n\\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\\n\\nDistribution:\\n\\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\\n\\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \\nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\\nheaders, and on article content.\\n\\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\\n\\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\\nspread of misinformation.\\n\\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\\n\\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\\nto be supported in your area.\\n\\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\\n\\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\\n\\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\\n\\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\\nquite useless.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Lemons:\\n\\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don\\'t waste everyone\\'s time by\\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x\\' automobile is terrible, so all\\n`brand x\\' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\\nthe `brand x\\' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Flames:\\n\\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\\nof this posting):\\n\\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don\\'t imagine for a\\nminute that including the words `No Flames\\' will work.  It won\\'t, and\\nyou\\'ll get exactly what you deserve.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to flame, you\\'re more likely to get away with it if you can\\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\\nbald, unsupported assertions.\\n\\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\\n\\n\\nAsking the Question:\\n\\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\\nsend email, I don\\'t read this group\\'.  It is a much better idea to\\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\\nI\\'ll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\\nto this request\\'.\\n\\nAnswering the Question:\\n\\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don\\'t tell them to get a Mustang.\\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\\ndefending a speeding ticket, don\\'t tell them to obey the law next time --\\nit\\'s offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn\\'t directly\\naddress the original question.  In general, don\\'t post in order to see\\nyour words in print, and don\\'t post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\\nself-righteous.\\n\\n\\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\\n\\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers\\'; while discussion of\\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\\nof these topics include the following:\\n\\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\\n\\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\\n    radar detectors.\\n\\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\\n\\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car\\' group -- everyone would argue\\n    about what constitutes a `sports car\\'.)\\n\\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver\\'s\\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\\n\\n6)  `Buy American\\' discussions\\n\\n7)  `clever\\' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\\n\\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\\n\\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\\n          Until then, please don\\'t waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\\n\\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis\\'\\'  -- Carroll Smith\\n',\n",

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\",\n",

New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\\n\\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\\n\\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\\n    is only speculation at this time.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\",\n",

This article\\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\\n\\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\\nprobably not good enough.\\n\\nListserv:\\n\\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\\n\\nThe Alias file:\\n\\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\\n\\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\\n\\n\\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo\\' on that host is\\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\\npossible email list is \\n\\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\\n\\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin\\'s home directory,\\nowned by the list admin.\\n\\nBounced Mail:\\n\\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\\nby the way.  I\\'m not sure where he got it from.)\\n\\n\\nschool-request:   welty\\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\\nowner-school: school-request\\nowner-school-out: school-request\\n\\n\\nhere\\'s what is going on here:\\n\\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\\nof contact for administrative duties.\\n\\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\\nactual list members.\\n\\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\\n\\n-----------------\\n#!/bin/sh\\ncd /tmp\\nsed -e \\'/^Reply-To:/d\\' -e \\'/^Sender:/d\\' -e \\'/^From /d\\' | \\\\\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\\\n         cat -) | \\\\\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\\nexit 0\\n-------------------\\n\\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\\n\\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\\nHopefully I\\'ll be able to provide more information in a future version\\nof this posting.\\n\\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis\\'\\'  -- Carroll Smith\\n',\n",

Intentionally blocking a person\\nriding your bumper is certainly NOT a \"wise driving practice\", it \\nonly causes the jam to become more congested. \\n \\nI don\\'t mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the \\nroad behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a \"pack\" \\nof vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you \\ndecribe.

If someone decides then to \\npull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and \\ndo so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I \\nfeel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the \\nactions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers \\non the road who do not intentionally impede others.  \\n\\nIf someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they \\nare blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all \\nelse fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the \\nmessage that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never \\nsafe to ride anyone\\'s bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking \\ntraffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty \\nor for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,\\nderision.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\\'s\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i\\'m sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n\\n\\neliot\\n',\n",

A family sedan designed to be\\noperable at 85mph doesn\\'t suddenly become operable at 130mph because\\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\\nlarger engine.

Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\\n   speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in\\n   the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not\\n   much higher than 120km/h.\\n\\nI strongly suspect you won\\'t find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

After\\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\\nthat if he didn\\'t have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton\\'s \"Don\\'t Get Taken Every Time\" for a\\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you\\'ll have to\\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\\nthousand dollars we\\'ll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can\\'t come down any\\nmore so I guess we can\\'t help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\\nleaving us sitting in the salesman\\'s office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\\nI\\'d read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he\\'d announced\\nthat our business was over, he shouldn\\'t care, and every time I tried\\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won\\'t bother him anymore,\\nwe\\'re going next door to the Nissan dealership.\\n\\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.\\n\\nJust so the guilty won\\'t go unpunished, I\\'ll mention that the\\nsales manager\\'s name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his\\nrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the\\nend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was\\na young novice) that he\\'d be able to get at least X dollars out of\\nus, and he was steamed that we wouldn\\'t fall for his slimy tricks.\\n',\n",

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\\n>the following to be true:\\n\\nMy knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can\\ncorrect your statements about our Autobahn:\\n\\n>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\\n\\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I\\'ve\\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he\\'d never drive a car in\\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined\\' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\\nto fear\\': \\nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you\\'re ex-\\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\\nhandle it - or you lose... \\nThat\\'s the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \\nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\\nand each accident is one accident too much.\\n\\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\\n\\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that\\'s the right word - \\na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it\\'s about 2 feet high);\\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\\n\\n>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\\n>   speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in\\n>   the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not\\n>   much higher than 120km/h.\\n\\nYou\\'re right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\\nin Germany (I\\'ve been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can\\'t rely on the residents abiding\\nthe local speed limits. I\\'ve got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I\\'m\\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\\n\\n>I strongly suspect you won\\'t find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\\n>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...\\n\\nSorry, but you\\'ll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip\\' over\\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren\\'t afraid to let them run.\\n\\n>                                                      ...  Some people\\n>have no respect for their own lives.\\n\\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\\na bicycle: Your\\'re dead.\\n\\nBye,\\nStefan\\n---\\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being the\\nreincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

While it doesn\\'t\\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \\n\\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn\\'t changed\\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\\nProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \\npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll find\\nthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides\\ndifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\\nthe heat.

Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic\\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\\nbut that\\'s it.  No change holders.

I won the battle but \\nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \\ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \\nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \\nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \\nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \\nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \\nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \\ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \\nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \\nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \\nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \\na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\\'s \\nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \\npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \\nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\\n\\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \\ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \\nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \\nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \\nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \\nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \\nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \\na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \\nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \\nfor my insurance.\\n\\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \\nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \\nthat required attention included the transmission, \\nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \\nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \\ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \\nleast four attempts.\\n\\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \\nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \\npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \\nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\\n\\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\\n\\n',\n",

When that light goes on, I just\\ntake it to the delaer tell them \"It\\'s that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou\\nand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)\\nI currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for\\nservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the\\nOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have\\nnever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.\\nNow, I don\\'t have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have\\nsomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only\\nMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced\\nif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and\\nGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  \\n\\nWhat I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need\\nto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don\\'t worry about the car for\\nanother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light\\nbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against\\nthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light\\nwill go off.  I do that so that little light won\\'t annoy me.  If you can\\'t\\nfind it, look it up in the car manuel.

Others charge according to your city.\\nAnyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's\\nwhat I found (for a '93 Integra GS):\\n\\nAAA: ~$2000/yr.\\nState Farm: 2614.92/yr.\\nAllstate: 1220/yr.\\n\\nAAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about\\n$200-300 back at the end of the year.\\n\\nStill, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm\\nwants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be\\nsuspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.\\n\\nAny comments?\\n\\nThanks,\\nGregg L.

My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  \\nshowing the same behavior.\\n\\nI replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  \\nabout $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  \\nrebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  \\nhave cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.\\n\\nThe Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  \\nengine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  \\npart was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  \\nrounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   \\nWow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  \\nthe new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.\\n\\nThis is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  \\nmanual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  \\ncylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.\\n\",\n",

My previous\\ncar had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. \\nThe locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory\\nservice manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was\\nsupposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking\\nnut.

They have been made to\\nbe exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the\\npackage and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems\\nwith the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\\n& i\\'ve studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as \"dogs\"\\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\\n\\nMotorcycle transmissions don\\'t have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \\nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn\\'t a neutral\\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can\\'t select it with the\\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\\n\\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\\nand sometimes first).  \\n\\n--\\nFrank Ball   1UR-M          frankb@sad.hp.com    (707) 794-4168 work,\\nHewlett Packard             (707) 794-3844 fax,  (707) 538-3693 home\\n1212 Valley House Drive     IT175, XT350, Seca 750, \\'62 F-100, PL510\\nRohnert Park CA 94928-4999  KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I\\'m the NRA.\\n',\n",

BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me\\nnowhere.  After being routed to a \"Firebird Specialist\", I was able\\nto confirm that this is in fact the case.\\n\\nAt first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.\\nShe wouldn\\'t go into any details, so I don\\'t know if there were some\\nshipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they\\nsimply didn\\'t have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she\\nwas pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,\\nfeel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.\\n\\nSecond, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related\\nto the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is\\na production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was\\nnot wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore\\nhaving to wait for the right high quality parts...  I\\'m not positive\\nthat this applies to the Camaro as well, but I\\'m guessing it would.\\n\\nCan anyone else shed some light on this?\\n\\nChris S.\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nChris Silvester      | \"Any man capable of getting himself elected President\\nchriss@sam.amgen.com |  should by no means be allowed to do the job\"\\nchriss@netcom.com    |   - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

This means that the car may\\n\\tnot have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver\\n\\tand or hobby car.

Don\\'t leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.\\n\\tSince you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a\\n\\tfew hours in reading the \"Corvette Buyer\\'s Guide\" and purchase Noland\\n\\tAdams\\' tape \"How to Buy a Corvette.\"  The tape shows you how to check\\n\\tfor damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the\\n\\tvalue, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The\\n\\tlist is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where\\n\\tthere are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage\\n\\tvettes) that are available to help you.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\\n  of the course - we don\\'t want to have to separate someone\\'s bumper\\n  from their vehicle :) .\\n\\nThe Particulars:\\n\\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\\n* A valid drivers license is required\\n* Suggested equipment:\\n      CB Radio\\n      Compass\\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\\n      Clip Board and Pencil\\n* No alcohol during rally\\n* For more information contact\\n   Gary (815)727-3415\\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\\n   Brian (708)979-6083\\n\\n\\n                                            __\\n              Instant                      /\\\\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\\\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\\n------|---------------------------------------------\\n Exit |              |             |         ^\\n 257  |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n      |                            | Exit\\n      |                            | 130B\\n      |                            |\\n   \\n',\n",

I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable\\nthan the Camaro is now.  You know, that\\'s MHO.  \\n\\nThe differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,\\njust the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is\\nbarely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that\\ncan only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line\\nwith screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;\\nit\\'s those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come\\nwith the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they\\'re\\ngetting better and making the move in the right direction.\\n\\nThey beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only\\nin words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the\\nend of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part\\nsince there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn\\'t\\npress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.\\nBesides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.\\n\\nI do not put much stock in the mag rags\\' \"inside\" information, or even\\nFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was\\nfinally disclosed in it\\'s entirety.  \"Inside\" information had the\\nTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn\\'t look\\nfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself\\nif you do.  There\\'s a lot of potential.  Ford hasn\\'t released a new\\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\\nmodular V8\\'s are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\\ncompetition, don\\'t rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\\nwho really knows what it\\'ll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\\nHighly.\\n\\nThe next Mustang will be Ford\\'s highest profile car.  It attracts\\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it\\'s heritage\\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don\\'t lie to yourself and\\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\\n\\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\\nintelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\"  Some of\\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be\\nno clear winner.\\n\\nUnless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.

A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air\\n   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is\\n   low.\\n\\nNo scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from\\nthe turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.\\n\\nInterestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output \\nand mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket\\nturbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,\\nand these are approved by the CARB.\\n\\nDan Hepner\\n',\n",

ABout\\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \\nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\\nproblem.\\n\\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\\norder to actuate the clutch.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\\n\\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\\n\\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What\\ncan you suggest here?\\n\\nMany thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...\\n\\nBill Christens-Barry\\ncerulean@access.digex.com\\n\\n\",\n",

I have been\\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\\n\\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\\nplugs and valve adjustment.\\n\\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\\nhighway.\\n\\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn\\'t bother me at all -- it seems\\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\\nVisibility from the driver\\'s seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\\n\\n    In fact, I\\'m starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\\nride later in this review.\\n\\n\\nEngine:\\n    \\n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\\nI don\\'t make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\\n(More on this later.)\\n\\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\\n\\n    I\\'ve noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\\nadequate, it doesn\\'t come fully online until those other 12 valves\\nare used.\\n\\n\\nTransmission:\\n\\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend\\'s parent\\'s SHO in 1990, and\\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\\n\\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\\nlarger and more forgiving.\\n\\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you\\'d expect\\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it\\'s\\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it\\'s\\na clumsy shifter.\\n\\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\\npretty amazing in a car like this.\\n\\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\\nToyota and my friend\\'s Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\\n\\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don\\'t know whether the rod shifter\\nupgrade would help at all.\\n\\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\\nwere because I\\'ve never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\\nshifts in higher gears.)\\n\\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \\nget it into gear.  I\\'ll be watching this carefully in the next couple\\nof months.\\n\\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\\n\\n\\nExterior:\\n\\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\\ndon\\'t age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\\n\\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I\\'ve seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\\n\\n    I don\\'t think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\\n\\n\\nInterior:\\n\\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don\\'t deserve the\\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \\n\\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\\ncassette tapes.  There\\'s map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\\nglove compartment.\\n\\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\\nsink.  Hey, I\\'m really impressed with the ergonomics and\\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it\\'s a 1989, before the\\ninterior was upgraded!\\n\\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I\\'ve had.  Why do they need so\\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\\n\\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\\nwhat I hear, it\\'s not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver\\'s has\\ncracked and I\\'m not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\\nway.\\n\\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don\\'t have a normal\\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I\\'m getting used to\\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\\n\\n\\nRide:\\n\\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It\\'s stiffer than\\nany car I\\'ve had.  A friend\\'s new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn\\'t flex at all -- I\\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\\n\\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It\\'s a relatively\\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I\\'ve tried to find out what\\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\\n\\n    Over the past three days, I\\'ve oscillated between thinking the\\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I\\'ve discovered, as with\\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you\\'ll have no reason\\nto complain.  Let me explain...\\n\\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\\navoid the limits of traction -- and I\\'m a happy camper again.\\n\\n    It\\'s not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\\n\\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn\\'t seem so\\nuseful.  However, it\\'s reasonable, but it doesn\\'t communicate the road\\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it\\'s much better\\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\\n\\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\\n\\n\\nMiscellaneous notes:\\n\\n    GRIPES:\\n\\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\\n\\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\\n\\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\\n\\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\\n\\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\\n\\tand torque steer, I\\'ve never complained about ride.\\n\\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\\n\\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \\n\\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\\n\\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\\n\\tfor four.\\n\\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\\n\\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don\\'t\\n\\treally mind...  and sometimes think it\\'s an okay idea!!!\\n\\tPretty ridiculous, though.\\n\\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\\n\\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\\n\\tdown low.\\n\\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\\n\\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\\n\\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn\\'t it?)\\n\\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\\n\\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \\n\\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\\n\\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\\n\\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\\n\\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\\n\\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\\n\\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\\n\\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \\n\\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \\n\\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \\n\\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \\n\\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\\n\\n    The driver\\'s power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\\n    \\tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\\n\\tother windows work smoothly.\\n\\n\\n    LIKES:\\n\\n    I\\'m liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\\n    \\tcupholders are great.\\n\\n    I didn\\'t expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\\n\\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\\n\\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\\n\\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\\n\\n    I really feel like I don\\'t deserve this car.  I really can\\'t\\n\\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \\n\\tahead of schedule.  :-)\\n\\n    I love this car so much that I\\'ve been telling my parents to\\n\\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\\n\\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\\n\\tand ended up with this.  \\n\\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\\n\\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \\n\\tcar.  I don\\'t like thinking about getting another car, but at this\\n\\tpoint in time, I\\'m sure I\\'d buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\\n\\tcan\\'t beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\\n\\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\\n\\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\\n\\tthe horsepower.  \\n\\n\\n\\nOther Odds and Ends:\\n\\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\\nhaven\\'t joined yet, but I\\'ve noticed that queries about SHOs still\\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\\n\\n    I\\'ve put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I\\'ll be \\nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \\n\\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\\nI don\\'t know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \\nmaybe someone out there does.\\n\\n\\nGene Kim\\n(genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I don\\'t care if there are going to\\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\\njust looking, you don\\'t even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn\\'t have been.\\n\\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\\n\\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\\n\\nEngine \\n4 Alternators\\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\\n2 Water pumps\\n5 thermostats\\nHall effect sensor\\nMain computer\\n4 Batteries\\n\\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\\n\\nRadiator\\nAutomatic Transmission\\nPower Steering\\n\\n\\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it\\'s a good car, I\\njust can\\'t find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\\nworth of repairs over it\\'s lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\\n\\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\\nproduct again, no way.  I don\\'t care how good the LH cars look good, and I\\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\\nisn\\'t much better, thank god, they don\\'t control Saturn, like they do\\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\\n\\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\\n\\nAnd although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, I\\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\\nchrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You\\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\\nare still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.  They have the\\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It\\'s called\\ncompetition gentleman/women if you don\\'t satisfy the demand of the\\nconsumer, well your out..  \\n\\n*asbestos suit on*\\n\\nGaia\\n\\n',\n",

When making turns, especially when accelerating,\\n   there is usually a loud \"thunk\" from the rear of\\n   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.\\n   What could cause this?  Is the differential going\\n   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,\\n   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,\\n   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the\\n   trunk!)  \\n\\n2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from\\n   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves\\n   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the\\n   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?\\n\\n3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable\\n   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is\\n   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to\\n   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel\\n   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes\\n   might help -- could anything else cause this?\\n\\n4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting\\n   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from\\n   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more\\n   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.\\n   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put\\n   through all the gears and then back to park, as per\\n   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.\\n\\n5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have\\n   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps\\n   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are\\n   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?\\n\\nI\\'d be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners\\nout there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,\\nthese cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted\\ninto taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a\\njunk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be\\njunked.

But in case there are\\nsome misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn\\'t updated his data\\nfile on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer\\na luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do\\nhave at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is\\nthat there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and\\nbuses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is\\nno place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration\\nwanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide\\nhis or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.\\n\\n\\tAlso, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn\\'t the only\\ncar manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and\\nI believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as\\nMercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still\\nquite expensive.\\n\\n\\tFinally, please ignore Henry\\'s posting about Korean politics\\nand bureaucracy.  He\\'s quite uninformed.\\n-- \\nT. H.

I am quite happy to\\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I\\'d be much\\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\\nruined.\\n\\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\\nsome makes it through to the driver\\'s hands.  So there is feel and\\nthere is accuracy in the S4\\'s steering.  But there is also room for\\nimprovement.  I consider the S4\\'s steering to be better than the\\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\\n\\n\\n2) Engine\\n\\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there\\'s only 2.2\\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\\n\\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\\na heavy car, one\\'s body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\\n\\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I\\'d say that\\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I\\'d rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi\\'s own V8 is also far more musical,\\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\\nmatch its grunt.\\n\\nThe only hint of the engine\\'s true capacity occurs when one is taking\\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \\nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\\n\\n\\n3) Chassis\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \\n\\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4\\'s body feels like it has been carved\\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4\\'s ride quality will\\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\\npony cars.\\n\\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\\nable to test the car\\'s cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX\\'s clinical\\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\\n\\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\\nwell too, though I\\'ve read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400\\'s fade performance is nothing to\\nbrag about; neither is the Q45\\'s or the Legend\\'s.  Brake fade these days\\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody\\'s attention is focused on\\nanti-lock capability.\\n\\n\\n4) Comfort\\n\\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the \\'92 S4.  All the expected\\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\\nbecause Audi hasn\\'t gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \\n\\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\\n\\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn\\'t\\nconsider the Lexus\\' advantage in this area to be significant enough\\nto sway a potential buyer.\\n\\n\\n5) Conclusion\\n\\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\\nit doesn\\'t produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \\ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \\nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\\nall out exciting and intoxicating.\\n\\n\\neliot\\n\\n',\n",

Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue\\nfor pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:\\n1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is\\nsome number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)\\n\\n2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver\\nwas drunk)\\n\\n3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal\\nto regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever\\nhappening).\\n\\nYou are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can\\nstill sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited\\ntort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who\\ntreats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In\\nexchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save\\n$150/year.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse\\npeople so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.\\nI guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance\\ncompanies would be pushing harder for repeal.\\n\",\n",

I\\'d like to give some feedback based on\\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\\n\\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\\nwas another trap.  And there was!\\n\\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \\nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\\ntrap when there was none.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\\n\\n                                       -Barry\\n-- \\n-----                                                                   --------\\nBarry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com\\nChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319\\nChelmsford, MA                                                 \\n',\n",

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.\\nSince the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless \\nI do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a \"popping\" or \"hitting\" sound.\\nThe dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say \\nthis is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?\\nAnd about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK\\nwhile attempting to put it in reverse:\\n   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.\\n   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is\\n      fully depressed.\\n   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.\\n   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was\\n      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if\\n      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)\\n   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having \\n      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),\\n      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.\\n   6- The shifter acted normally after that.\\n\\nWhen this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the \\nclutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.\\n\\nI had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last\\nweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because \\nMitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the\\nproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while\\nthey had the car.  \\nIn all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,\\nand since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed\\nto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily\\nsolving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to\\nsend someone to check the car while it was stuck. \\nI KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting \\nfrom 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can\\'t get \\nthe dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, \\nand with how to handle Mitsubishi.  \\nAll hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to\\nbore you with the long post.\\n\\nThanks,\\nRabih.\\n',\n",

It originally\\nhad a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based\\non the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear\\nand a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was\\nlimited as a performer.\\n\\nThere has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other\\nmodels.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that\\nwere also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer\\n1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,\\nand a \"sport coupe\", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there\\nwere two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900\\nengine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also\\navailable as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,\\nbut was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.\\n\\nIn 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last\\nyear for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations\\nand the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing\\nto build the GTs.\\n\\nThe 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the\\nManta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with\\nBosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and\\nwider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century\\nlow price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.\\n\\nFrom 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by\\nthe Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them\\nOpels instead of changing the dealers\\' neon signs.\\n\\nVarious models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the\\n70\\'s in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.\\n\\nParts are still available from a number of sources.\\n\\n(I still have a \\'73 manta and two \\'75 sedans and all the trick parts I could\\ncollect in 20 years).\\n-- \\nJohn Kennedy                     uunet!opel!johnk\\nSecond Source, Inc.              johnk@secondsource.COM \\nAnnapolis, MD\\n',\n",

Bowers)\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: yfn.ysu.edu\\n\\n\\nIn a previous article, gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W. Mahan) says:\\n\\n>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but\\n>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty complex, and Cd isn\\'t the whole story either.  Cd for cars is\\nusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car\\nwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a\\npoorer Cd. \\n\\nTo calculate drag use this formula:\\n\\nD = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S\\n\\nWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),\\nV is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the\\npieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure\\n(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). \\n\\nNote that power is:\\n\\nP = F * v\\n\\nWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v\\nis velocity (ft/s). \\n\\nNote that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for\\nforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That\\'s why huge increases in power\\nresult in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. \\n\\nSo if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top\\nspeed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)\\n\\n101 mph\\n\\nSorry to dissappoint.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nAl Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  \\'blad  Iaido  NASA\\n\"Well goodness sakes...don\\'t you know that girls can\\'t play guitar?\"\\n                                             -Mary Chapin-Carpenter\\n',\n",

The shock\\nsensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have\\non my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,\\nbut any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It\\nworks great.\\n\\n> \\n> What worries me is the hood and hatch.

You can adjust\\nit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without\\nsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\\nalarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has\\nbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's\\ncause and it was not a false alarm.\\n> \\n> I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl\\n> underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm.\\n> \\nI guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight\\nin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are\\nsupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't\\nhave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm\\nwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.\\n\\n> Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that\\n> supposedly detects people approcahing the car....\\n> \\nThis is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at\\nthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want\\nto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so\\nthat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that\\nwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.\\nI don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you\\nleave the top down on.\\n\\nAvoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to\\npeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would\\ntaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. \\nThe owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.\\n> \\n> I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems\\n> and about the viper in general.\\n> \\nI am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune\\nit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable\\nthe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the\\nalarm is armed/disarmed.  \\n\\nI like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine\\nflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be\\ncareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your\\nkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are\\nmeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.\\n> The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape!\\n> \\n> \\n> Ron Garnett\\n> \\n\\nI looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but\\nmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. \\nThe shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)\\nthan the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good\\nvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. \\nExcept maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. \\nAnyone know where we can get one of those installed?

It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes\\nthe situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet\\nmust buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed\\nmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my\\ntruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts\\nrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet \\nsays that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\"\\n\\nAlso, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the\\ngear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about\\n55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,\\nthe RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should\\npoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a\\ndetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They\\ndropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\"\\nreasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.\\nOther things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times \\nso far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being\\nshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between\\nstabilizer and control arm fell off).\\n\\nAny company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What\\nreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt\\nto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for \\nthem to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new\\nFord F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never\\nbuy another Chevrolet.\\n\\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\\n',\n",

Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear\\naxels, ford 9\" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i \\nbusted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and \\nhaven\\'t had a problem since.

The post 80 broncos have that sickly\\nTTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were\\nas the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective\\nwheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few\\ndings in the sheet metal.  I don\\'t know when the removeable tops were\\ndiscontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top\\nfor 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don\\'t ever break the window if you\\nhave the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over\\n400 bucks to replace.

You guys must all think I\\'m\\nnuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this\\narea and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state\\nas well as surrounding states.  Here\\'s how I found out:\\n\\n- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn\\'t even know \\n  what Ka is.  He\\'s heard of K, which is what they use here and I\\n  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,\\n  \"Ka stands for K automatic\"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that\\n  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high\\n  tech were concerned, but he didn\\'t know too much.\\n\\n- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,\\n  even the real sneaky ones.\\n\\n- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here\\n  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used\\n  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.\\n\\nSo in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting\\nmonths for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high\\nperformance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal\\nto their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that\\nEscort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I\\'ve never fully\\nrelied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at\\nleast quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.\\n\\n\\neliot\\n',\n",
